# Advent of Code 2024 - Zig
Solutions for AOC 2024.

This was a **learning** project. I am a Data Scientist and ML Engineer who used these exercises to learn:
 - Lower level programming
 - Zig language https://ziglang.org/
 - Neovim editor https://neovim.io/

The solutions are probabbly not optimal but manage to get the work done.
